        <p> The assignment was to create a prgram that allowed the user to plot points and then connect the points in order to make the letter "E" or any other shapeThis program was created on Snap. You can plot as many points as you want and it will connect the points to draw a shape! You can also draw an "A" by clicking the green flag. See what awesome shapes you can come up with!</p>

        <p> The asssignment was to create a drawing app for kids to be able to use. The language used to create the program was Snap. In this program you can draw custom shapes, polygons, and you can free draw with a pen tool! Click the green flag to run the program. In the app there is a penguin and a question mark sprite that, when clicked, will give the user instructions on how to operate every feature on the app. Something I learned was how to make other codes in the program not able to be run so that the there is only one code running at a time and they don't interfere with each other. I solved this problem by making a variable and have the scripts only run when the variable is a 0 so the draw shape program can run without interference. </p>
